The causal relationships are: low urbanization causes high socio-economic mobility, and high interest in religion causes high socio-economic mobility. In the current observation, urbanization is low (which should increase the likelihood of high socio-economic mobility), but interest in religion is normal (which does not increase the likelihood). Since one strong causal factor is present (low urbanization), and the other is neutral (normal interest in religion), it is reasonable to estimate that the likelihood of high socio-economic mobility is above average but not at the maximum.
