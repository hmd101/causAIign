Small trade deficits directly cause high retirement savings by indicating a good economy where people can save. Low interest rates also cause high retirement savings by stimulating economic growth and prosperity. Since we observe high retirement savings and small trade deficits, the presence of small trade deficits alone can explain the high retirement savings without necessarily requiring low interest rates. However, low interest rates could still be present and contributing. Given that small trade deficits are observed and they cause high retirement savings, the likelihood of low interest rates being present is moderate but not certain.
