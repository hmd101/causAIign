400;<response><explanation>Given the observations of high ozone levels and high air pressure, both of these conditions are known to cause low humidity. High ozone levels attract extra oxygen atoms from water molecules, creating a concentration of water vapor and thus reducing humidity. Similarly, high air pressure causes water vapor to condense into liquid water, leaving the atmosphere with little moisture. Therefore, it is highly likely that low humidity is present.</explanation><likelihood>95</likelihood><confidence>90</confidence></response>;N/A;N/A;CoT;overloaded;collider;weath_ovl_e=econ;k;pmm;gpt-4;0.0

Therefore, the observation of normal air pressure does not provide any information about the ozone levels. Without additional information, we cannot estimate the likelihood of low ozone levels.

This suggests that there must be another factor compensating for the low ozone levels to maintain normal humidity. The only other factor provided that could affect humidity is air pressure.
