Since either of these causes could explain the observed high humidity, it is not certain that low ozone levels are present. However, since low ozone is a potential cause, it is more likely than if there were no causal link.  Since there are two independent causes, and we have no other information, it is reasonable to assume they are equally likely. Therefore, there is approximately a 50% chance that low ozone is the cause of the high humidity.</reasoning><likelihood>50</likelihood><confidence>50</confidence></response>

High humidity can be caused by either low ozone levels or high air pressure. Since we know that one of the causes of high humidity is present (low ozone), this makes it less likely that the other cause is also present (high air pressure). If high air pressure were also present, the humidity would be extremely high, perhaps higher than typical for a low-ozone system. Therefore, the presence of low ozone makes the presence of high air pressure less likely, but not impossible.</reasoning><likelihood>25</likelihood><confidence>70</confidence></response>
