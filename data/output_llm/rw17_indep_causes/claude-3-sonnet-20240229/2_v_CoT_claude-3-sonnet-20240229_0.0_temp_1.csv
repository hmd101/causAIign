However, normal air pressure does not directly cause high humidity according to the provided information. Therefore, the likelihood of high humidity is increased by the low ozone levels, but not necessarily guaranteed.</reasoning><likelihood>75</likelihood><confidence>80</confidence></response>;CoT;collider;weather;j;mmp;claude-3-sonnet-20240229;0.0
