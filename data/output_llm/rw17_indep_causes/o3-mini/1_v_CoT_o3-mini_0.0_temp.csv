Since there is no evidence suggesting high humidity and no described dependence between air pressure and ozone, the prior probability of low ozone remains unchanged from its baseline.

450;<response><reasoning>Normal ozone rules out the low-ozone→high-humidity pathway, meaning that if high humidity were observed it would be attributable to high air pressure. However, without any observation about humidity, we have no additional evidence to infer that high air pressure is present. Therefore, lacking further clues, a baseline estimate of about 50 out of 100 seems reasonable.</reasoning><likelihood>50</likelihood><confidence>60</confidence></response>;CoT;collider;weather;e;mmp;o3-mini;0.0
