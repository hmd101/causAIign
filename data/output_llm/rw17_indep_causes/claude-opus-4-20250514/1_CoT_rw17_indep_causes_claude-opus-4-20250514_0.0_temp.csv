We have two causal relationships that can lead to high retirement savings: (1) low interest rates causes high retirement savings, and (2) small trade deficits causes high retirement savings. We also know that small trade deficits are present. Since small trade deficits can fully explain the presence of high retirement savings, low interest rates are not necessary to explain the observation. However, low interest rates could still be present as an additional cause. Without information about whether these causes are mutually exclusive or how often they co-occur, and given that one sufficient cause is already present, the probability of low interest rates being present is somewhat lower than it would be if we only observed high retirement savings without knowing about the trade deficit.
