1;<response><reasoning>Low interest rates and small trade deficits are two independent causal paths that can each lead to high retirement savings. Given we already observe a small trade deficit (one effective cause), the observed high retirement savings is largely accounted for without needing low interest rates. Still, if low interest rates were also present, the joint probability of seeing high retirement savings would be a bit higher, so the evidence nudges the likelihood of low interest rates above its prior but not by much. A simple Bayesian calculation with plausible priors (P(low rates)=0.3, P(small deficit)=0.3) and assuming each cause raises the chance of high savings from about 0.2 to 0.8 yields P(low rates | high savings, small deficit) ≈ 0.33.
