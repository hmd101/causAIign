From the causal relationships: 1) Low interest rates causes high retirement savings, and 2) Small trade deficits causes high retirement savings. Since we observe both high retirement savings and small trade deficits, we know that small trade deficits is definitely contributing to the high retirement savings. However, high retirement savings could be caused by either low interest rates alone, small trade deficits alone, or both factors together. Since small trade deficits is present and sufficient to cause high retirement savings, low interest rates is not necessary to explain our observations.

From the causal relationships: 1) Low interest rates causes high retirement savings, and 2) Small trade deficits causes high retirement savings. Both low interest rates and small trade deficits are causes that lead to the same effect (high retirement savings). Since we know small trade deficits are present, this increases the likelihood that high retirement savings exists. However, knowing that small trade deficits are present doesn't directly tell us about interest rates. The two causes (low interest rates and small trade deficits) appear to be independent - neither is described as causing the other. Since both can independently cause high retirement savings, and we know one cause (small trade deficits) is present, this doesn't significantly change the baseline probability of the other cause (low interest rates) being present.

We know: 1) The economy currently has normal retirement savings and small trade deficits. 2) Low interest rates causes high retirement savings. 3) Small trade deficits causes high retirement savings. Given that small trade deficits are present, we would expect high retirement savings according to the causal relationship. However, we observe normal retirement savings instead of high retirement savings. This suggests that either the causal relationship from small trade deficits to high retirement savings is not operating as expected, or there's another factor counteracting it. If low interest rates were present, combined with small trade deficits, we would expect even higher retirement savings since both factors cause high retirement savings. But we only see normal retirement savings. This makes it less likely that low interest rates are present, because if they were, the retirement savings should be high given the small trade deficits.
