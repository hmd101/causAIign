1;<response><explanation>We observe high retirement savings and small trade deficits. Small trade deficits is given as a cause of high retirement savings (i.e., good economy → high savings), so that observation can be explained without invoking low interest rates. Low interest rates are another (alternative) cause of high retirement savings. Because high retirement savings is already explained by small trade deficits, evidence for low interest rates is weakened (explaining-away). There is no direct causal link between small trade deficits and low interest rates mentioned, so small trade deficits neither supports nor contradicts low interest rates except via the explained-away effect. Thus probability of low interest rates is reduced relative to a prior but not ruled out.
