Prior base rates are unknown, so assume noninformative equal priors for low PtY@gj'mU- and weak h#Bel31iEl (50% each) and that each cause alone would be sufficient to produce powerful )2h+pC==-h. Using noisy-OR: P(powerful)=1-(1-P(PtY))(1-P(h#Bel)). With both priors 0.5, P(powerful)=1-(0.5)(0.5)=0.75. We observe powerful, so posterior P(low PtY | powerful) = P(low PtY and powerful)/P(powerful). Assuming causes produce powerful whenever present and independently, P(low PtY and powerful)=P(low PtY)=0.5 minus overlap where both present counted once; more directly using noisy-OR Bayes: P(low PtY | powerful)=P(low PtY)*(1 - P(h#Bel)) / P(powerful) + P(low PtY)*P(h#Bel)/P(powerful) = P(low PtY)/P(powerful) * [1 - (1 - P(h#Bel))?].
