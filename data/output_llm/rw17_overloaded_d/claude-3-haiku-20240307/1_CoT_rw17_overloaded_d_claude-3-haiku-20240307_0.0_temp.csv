1) High air pressure causes high humidity, but the observation is that air pressure is normal, not high.
2) Therefore, the high humidity must be caused by another factor, which is low ozone levels.
3) Low ozone levels cause high humidity because the oxygen atoms that would normally be part of ozone molecules are free to combine with hydrogen atoms, creating more water molecules.

The causal relationship states that high air pressure causes high humidity, and the observation of high humidity supports this. However, since the ozone levels are normal, this suggests that the high humidity is not caused by low ozone levels, which would free up oxygen atoms to combine with hydrogen and increase humidity. Therefore, the high humidity is more likely due to the high air pressure, as described in the causal relationship.
