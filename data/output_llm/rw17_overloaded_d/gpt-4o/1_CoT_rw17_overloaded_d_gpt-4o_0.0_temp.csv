This means that the observed high retirement savings can be fully explained by the presence of small trade deficits. Low interest rates also cause high retirement savings, but since we already have an explanation for high retirement savings through small trade deficits, the presence of low interest rates is not necessary to explain the observation. Therefore, while low interest rates could still be present, they are not required to explain the current observations, making their presence less likely.
