According to the causal relationships: 1) Low interest rates cause high retirement savings, and 2) Small trade deficits cause high retirement savings. I observe high retirement savings, which could be caused by either low interest rates or small trade deficits (or both). I also observe small trade deficits, which we know is one cause of high retirement savings. Since I've observed small trade deficits, this already explains the high retirement savings. However, this doesn't rule out that low interest rates might also be present and contributing to high retirement savings. Without additional information about the base rates of low interest rates or how these causes interact, I can't determine with certainty whether low interest rates are present. Since small trade deficits already explain the high retirement savings, low interest rates aren't necessary to explain the observations, but they remain possible.

First, I'll analyze the causal relationships: 1) Low interest rates causes high retirement savings. 2) Small trade deficits causes high retirement savings. We've observed high retirement savings and low interest rates. The high retirement savings could be explained by either the low interest rates or small trade deficits (or both). Since we know low interest rates are present, we already have a sufficient explanation for the high retirement savings. The presence of small trade deficits would provide an additional explanation, but it's not necessary to explain what we're seeing. Given that low interest rates alone can explain high retirement savings, the observation of high retirement savings doesn't provide strong evidence for small trade deficits. However, small trade deficits could still be present.

This means there are two possible causes for the high retirement savings we observe. Using Bayesian reasoning, I need to consider the probability of low interest rates given high retirement savings. Since low interest rates is a direct cause of high retirement savings, there's a positive likelihood. However, high retirement savings could also be caused by small trade deficits, which means low interest rates aren't necessary for high retirement savings to occur. Without knowing the prior probabilities or the relative strengths of these causal relationships, I can only say that low interest rates are somewhat likely but not certain. Since there are exactly two possible causes for high retirement savings, and one of them is low interest rates, I would estimate the likelihood at around 50%.
