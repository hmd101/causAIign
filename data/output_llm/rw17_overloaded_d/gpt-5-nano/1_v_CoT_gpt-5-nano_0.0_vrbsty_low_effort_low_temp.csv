Brief assessment: With low ozone levels and normal air pressure, the primary causal route to low humidity is the stated low ozone → UV → breaks up water molecules, leading to lower humidity. The other path (low air pressure) is not active since pressure is normal. Therefore low humidity is likely but not guaranteed; I would estimate high likelihood.</explanation><likelihood>83</likelihood><confidence>65</confidence></response>";low;low;CoT;overloaded;collider;weath_ovl_d=ctl;j;mpm;gpt-5-nano;0.0
