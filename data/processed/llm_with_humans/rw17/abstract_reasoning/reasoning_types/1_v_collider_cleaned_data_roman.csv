Let's think about this using probability. If P(weak Z | weak Y) = 1 (since weak Y causes weak Z), then by Bayes' rule: P(weak Y | weak Z) = P(weak Z | weak Y) × P(weak Y) / P(weak Z). We don't know the prior probabilities P(weak Y) or P(weak Z), but we do know that weak Z can also be caused by high X.
