1,"In abstract reasoning studies, researchers examine relationships between symbolic variables A, B, and C. Here are some variables: Some systems have high A. Others have low A. Some systems have strong B. Others have weak B. Some systems have powerful C. Others have weak C.  Here are the causal relationships: High A causes powerful C. Strong B causes powerful C. Both high A and strong B can each cause powerful C on their own. That is, it's not the case that both of these have to be present in order for powerful C to be present. Rather, high A can independently cause powerful C on their own, and strong B can independently cause powerful C on their own as well. You are currently observing: powerful C and strong B. Your task is to estimate how likely it is that high A is present on a scale from 0 to 100, given the observations and causal relationships described. 0 means completely unlikely and 100 means completely likely. Provide your likelihood estimate and confidence level about your likelihood estimate (how certain you are about your likelihood estimate between 0 and 100 with 0 being very uncertain and 100 being very certain about your likelihood estimate).
