introduction: >
  Space mission engineers study the complex relationships between different systems 
  that determine the success of interplanetary missions. They examine how various 
  factors interact to influence mission outcomes in the hostile environment of space.

variables:
  X:
    name: "propulsion efficiency"
    detailed: "Propulsion efficiency refers to how effectively the spacecraft's engines convert fuel into thrust for navigation and maneuvering."
    p_values:
      "1": "optimal"
      "0": "suboptimal"
    m_values:
      "1": "suboptimal" 
      "0": "optimal"
      
  Y:
    name: "communication strength"
    detailed: "Communication strength indicates the reliability and clarity of data transmission between the spacecraft and mission control on Earth."
    p_values:
      "1": "strong"
      "0": "weak"
    m_values:
      "1": "weak"
      "0": "strong"
      
  Z:
    name: "mission success"
    detailed: "Mission success measures how well the spacecraft accomplishes its scientific and exploratory objectives."
    p_values:
      "1": "successful"
      "0": "unsuccessful"
    m_values:
      "1": "unsuccessful"
      "0": "successful"
