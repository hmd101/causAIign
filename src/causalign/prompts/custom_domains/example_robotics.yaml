introduction: >
  Robotics engineers study the complex relationships between different systems 
  that enable autonomous robots to function effectively. They examine how various 
  components interact to produce desired robotic behaviors.

variables:
  X:
    name: "sensor accuracy"
    detailed: "Sensor accuracy refers to how precisely the robot's sensors can detect and measure environmental conditions."
    p_values:
      "1": "high"
      "0": "low"
    m_values:
      "1": "low" 
      "0": "high"
      
  Y:
    name: "battery level"
    detailed: "Battery level indicates the amount of electrical energy available to power the robot's operations."
    p_values:
      "1": "full"
      "0": "depleted"
    m_values:
      "1": "depleted"
      "0": "full"
      
  Z:
    name: "task performance"
    detailed: "Task performance measures how successfully the robot completes its assigned objectives."
    p_values:
      "1": "excellent"
      "0": "poor"
    m_values:
      "1": "poor" 
      "0": "excellent"

# Optional: Custom explanations for specific variable combinations
# explanations:
#   X_causes_Z:
#     p_p: "High sensor accuracy leads to excellent task performance because the robot can make precise decisions."
#     m_m: "Low sensor accuracy results in poor task performance due to imprecise environmental readings."
